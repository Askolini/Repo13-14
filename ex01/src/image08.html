            <p>Jogging is a form of trotting or running at a slow or leisurely pace. The main intention is to increase physical fitness with less stress on the body than from faster running but more than walking, or to maintain a steady speed for longer
                periods of time. Performed over long distances, it is a form of aerobic endurance training.</p>
            <p>Jogging is running at a gentle pace, its definition, as compared with running, is not standard. One definition describes jogging as running slower than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h). Running is sometimes defined as requiring a moment of no contact
                to the ground, whereas jogging often sustains the contact.</p>
